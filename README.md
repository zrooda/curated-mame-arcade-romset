# Curated MAME Arcade ROMset

👉 [Click here for the raw list!](ROMSET)

A hand-picked set of the "Best | Weirdest | Memorable | Technical | Significant" Arcade games history has to offer (for MAME/FBNeo).

- Includes Neo Geo
- Expects a **non-merged** MAME set ([What?](https://wiki.romvault.com/doku.php?id=merge_types))
- [RetroAchievements.org](https://retroachievements.org/) versions preferred

_Make a PR if you're missing your favorite game!_

## Roadmap
- Bash/PowerShell scripts that copy the relevant .zip files and CHDs from a full set
- gamelist.xml and media for EmulationStation and other front-ends
